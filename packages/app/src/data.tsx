      '\nImagine if you could potentially alleviate the financial burdens of millions of people of millions of $ with just one small transaction. Our mobile web application consists of two primary entities: Clients and "Circuit Builders", or just "Builders".\n\nClients use the app to record their debts and the dynamic movements of these debts. On the other hand, Builders are entities who identify closed circuits of client debts and work towards freeing users from the chain by eliminating the smallest debt relation. Builders get tips from the Clients for this and also mint NFT as an incentive.\n\nTo put it simply, consider a scenario where person A owes person B $10, person B owes person C $10, and person C owes person A $10. In this case, they can collectively agree that nobody owes anything to anyone. 30$ debt reduced to 0$ debt. In the case the debts are not the same, every single debt is reduced by the smallest amount and one of the users is freed from that chain. While this concept is straightforward with just three people, it becomes increasingly complex to identify such circuits with tens, thousands, or even millions of individuals involved. Only a secure, tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized network can effectively uncover and help address such intricate debt circuits.',

      "DeFi is one of the main pillars of the Ethereum Ecosystem. Uniswap V3, although being one of the most popular DeFi protocol, has major problems for lp providers. Loanster aims to solve the main problems these problems and give a better DeFi experience to LP providers. \n\nWhile Uniswap V3 addressed issues like wasted liquidity and price impacts through concentrated liquidity, it introduced a higher risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers. In fact, over 50% of liquidity providers experience impermanent losses due to price fluctuations. \n\nFor example, in the case of investing in ETH+DAI position, if the ETH price goes up and the current price tick goes out of range, your position will change to 0% ETH and 100% DAI. In this case, you cannot gain any profit from the increase of the ETH price. Conversely, if ETH price drops, and your position changes to 100% ETH and 0% DAI, you will take all the losses directly. \n\nSo, Uniswap V3 can only profit in crab markets, when the price is stable and stays in a certain price range. In order to diversify our strategies, and be able to profit in bear or bull markets, we integrated the lending protocol in order to mitigate the impermanent losses. In a bullish market, we borrow DAI and deposit ETH as collateral. This way, we can take the benefits of the increase in the ETH price and still earn LP fees, maximizing our profits in the long strategy. In the bearish market, we do the exact opposite, by borrowing ETH and depositing DAI as collateral. Depending on the anticipated LP fees and anticipated price change, users could optimize profits by adjusting the borrowing rate.\n\nAlso, Uniswap V3 has a complex UX for preparing the exact amount of assets to add as liquidity for their position. Once they swap their assets in the pool, the ratio of their position will also change, so it is very difficult to put all of your desired assets into your position.\nLoanster solved this problem using the Loanster Contract, which calculates the exact amount to swap and add as liquidity for your position. \n\nAlso, defi infrastructures such as swaps and bridges are scattered, so you need to navigate through many different dApp pages. Loanster also aggregated these infrastructures and abstracted the complex process. It calculates the route for you, and all you need to do is press approve on a single page, and you\u2019re done investing! To summarize it all, people can enjoy a smooth UX and enjoy various investment strategies on a single page!",
