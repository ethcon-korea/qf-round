      '\nImagine if you could potentially alleviate the financial burdens of millions of people of millions of $ with just one small transaction. Our mobile web application consists of two primary entities: Clients and "Circuit Builders", or just "Builders".\n\nClients use the app to record their debts and the dynamic movements of these debts. On the other hand, Builders are entities who identify closed circuits of client debts and work towards freeing users from the chain by eliminating the smallest debt relation. Builders get tips from the Clients for this and also mint NFT as an incentive.\n\nTo put it simply, consider a scenario where person A owes person B $10, person B owes person C $10, and person C owes person A $10. In this case, they can collectively agree that nobody owes anything to anyone. 30$ debt reduced to 0$ debt. In the case the debts are not the same, every single debt is reduced by the smallest amount and one of the users is freed from that chain. While this concept is straightforward with just three people, it becomes increasingly complex to identify such circuits with tens, thousands, or even millions of individuals involved. Only a secure, tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized network can effectively uncover and help address such intricate debt circuits.',

Processes like prize disbursements, which could be efficiently replaced with smart contracts, were still wasting unnecessary manpower and resources. With these issues in mind, DECOHACKS emerged as a solution in the form of a decentralized hackathon platform. By integrating various L2 chains and the Semaphore technology, this platform aims to significantly enhance the transparency, security, and accessibility of hackathon operations.",
