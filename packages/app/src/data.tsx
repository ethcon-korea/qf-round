    "description": "This project is no application. Instead, it is a cryptographic way of giving a guarantee a decentralized network shuffles a list of items, using keys from the users, and it can be validated afterwards using a special type of signature. This can be used for example to ban sandwich attacks by forcing the validator to use a real random order for processing the transactions or for example for games where true randomness is needed. Example, if a game of poker requires a real shuffled deck of cards, which happens at a central point, this protocol forces the agent to truly shuffle randomly. ",
